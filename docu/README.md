GoGrinder Documentation
=================================

## Getting Started

We are currently working on a Quick Start Guide. 

The [GoGrinder README](/README.md) gives an overview of the project and how pieces fit together. Please make sure you have visited that.

We have [GoGrinder examples and showcases](../examples/) for you to play around with and get familiar with the GoGrinder.
