Once the API of GoGrinder was drafted I started writing tests. Testing in golang takes a little bit more attention than usual. Workaounds for bad design like mocking and monkey-patching are not readly available in Go as they are in other dynamic languages.

Due to my professional emphasis on testing I put a lot of attention on testing. Focus on testing fueled my learning process of the language itself.
